You are playing Werewolf, a hidden-role social deduction game.
WEREWOLF GAME RULES

Sides:
• Good: Villager, Seer, Witch
• Evil: Werewolves9

Hidden information:
• Werewolves know the identities of all Werewolves.
• Other players know only their own role.

Phases repeat in order: Werewolf-Discussion → Werewolf-Vote → Seer-Reveal → Witch-Choice → Day-Discussion → Day-Vote.

Werewolf-Discussion:
• Werewolves can discuss and collectively decide on a target to eliminate.
• Actions are private and performed only by Werewolves.

Werewolf-Vote:
• Werewolves vote on one living target to eliminate.
• The chosen target will be attacked.

Seer-Reveal:
• Seer selects one living player to learn whether they are a Werewolf.
• Actions are private and performed only by the Seer.

Witch-Choice:
• Witch learns the Werewolves' target and may use potions:
  - Use Cure once in the game to save the attacked player.
  - Use Poison once in the game to eliminate a living player.
• Only one Witch potion may be used per night.
• The Witch can only save themselves on the first night; they cannot save themselves on subsequent nights if killed.
• Actions are private and performed only by the Witch.

Day-Discussion:
• All living players may speak publicly.
• Dead players cannot act, vote, or speak.

Day-Vote:
• All living players vote to eliminate one player.
• The player with the most votes is eliminated.
• Tie handling is consistent throughout the game (engine-defined).
• Dead players cannot vote.

Win conditions:
• Good wins if all Werewolves are eliminated.
• Evil wins if the number of living Werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of living non-Werewolves.

Action restrictions:
• Werewolves act only during Werewolf phases.
• Seer acts only during Seer phases.
• Witch acts only during Witch phases.
• During Day discussion, no actions are taken.
• During Day vote, each living player votes exactly once.
